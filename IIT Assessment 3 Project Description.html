				 <h3>Overview</h3>
				 <h4>Topic</h4>
				 <p>
				 	Before talking about the content that we put in our project overview. We would say that this process is extremely helpful throughout the project. During the project progress, it makes for a great reference point for anyone who struggles with the details. Let's come to the main things. Our project called “Aim trainer” mainly is about a free browser system that is specifically designed to improve the user’s aim in various FPS games .There are two main criteria that must be met when we planned our project.
				 </p>
				 <p>
					 The first criteria is this project met the standard to improve people’s aim and their daily 
					 warm up before their game.
				 </p>
				 <p>
					 The second criteria we want to give the user’s more specific details about their skill. This system will be based on the data that our project conducted when they are using the system. Although our system is free to use, we want to provide a good experience for the user’s when they use the system and it will be better than the ones already released on the market. To support our project we also create a website to connect with the user more easily. For this part we applied many skills such as CSS/HTML, figma and some UI/UX rules.
				 </p>
				 <h4>Motivation</h4>
				 <p>
					 The inspiration for our team to make this project was we wanted to support the people who don’t really have much time or lost motivation to train their aim, or as a support system for pro-gamers to warm up before every match. Although we know that the user base may seem small, statistics from my favourite first-person shooter, CS:GO or Counter Strike: Global Offensive show an average of player base of 745,550.8 per day over the last 30 days (during the month of March 2021) which is a 0.61% gain from the previous month (source in bibliography). When we are researching what project we should do to help the community, we found that there are many gamers who are finding it hard to motivate themself train their aim. We really wanted to help this community because four of us also have a big passion for games, especially FPS games.
				 </p>
				 <p>
					 I think this program would be appealing towards gamers who enjoy competitive first-person shooters as improving their aim is desirable for anyone trying to improve. Not only would this appeal to people familiar with existing programs, but also people who are new to first-person shooters and would like to fast track their ability to aim, whilst also being able to analyse their improvement over time. Our team all think that this project will fit in current IT trends because there are many popular FPS games that have been established in the decade. For example: CS:GO, Valorant, Fortnite, etc. And all of them already have tournaments which many people attend.
				</p>
				<h4>Landscape</h4>
				<p>
					There are many aim training systems that have been established on Google and Steam. Most of them are free but there are some wonderful systems with many features that charge you some amount of money. The best free one that I suggest is Aim Lab and the best one with costs would be kovaak 2.0. These are two strong competitors that our team has to be careful with when producing our project to the market.
				</p>
				<p>
					Kovaak 2.0 is a definitive 2018s FPS aim training software, trusted and used by many current and former professional players from many different famous FPS games such as CS:GO, PUBG, Fortnite. These systems contain many functions such as customizable playlists, 9,500+ scenarios, guided training and analysis, and realistic physics. You can find it on Steam.<br>
					Aim Lab seems to be a better choice for those who don't want to put some money in the game. Aim labs may not have as many functions and features as Kovaak 2.0, however it is also a very good system which contains practice systems, data(feedback), and helps for warming up. It is also very popular, being used by a lot of novice and pro gamers because it is easy to search for on the internet.
				</p>
				<p>
					Based on the information we stated above, it is very difficult to compete with these two large brand aim trainer systems. However, our project has some advantages that can overtake these two.
				<ul>
					<li><b>More detailed relevant stats for players</b> (such as average and high score which can motivate the player to become better)</li>
					<li><b>Better crosshair design customisation</b> (changing color,setting,...)</li>
					<li><b>Ranking system</b> (motivate player)</li>
					<li><b>Change weapon</b> (diversity, make the game more attract)</li>
					<li><b>Tips</b> (help player to get better)</li>
					<li><b>Changeable Targets</b> (diversity, more challenging to play)</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<h3>Detailed Description</h3>
				<h4>Aims</h4>
				<p>
					In this project, the goal that our team members want to achieve is improve the user aiming skill. However, there were already some similar programs on the market. Our team desired to create a perfect project which has more detailed and features more analysis than the current program on the market. To be more specific, we want to conduct a survey to collect the data about:
					<ul>
						<li>speed (average reaction and a log of per shot reactions)</li>
						<li>precision (based off distance from centre of target</li>
						<li>accuracy (hit shots divided by total shots)</li>
						<li>directional weaknesses</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					After collecting all the data, our team will compare to the users average score. From that result, we will know what the users really need  to improve their aim. And based on that we will add in our system more functions to make it perfect.</p>
				<h4>Plans and Progression</h4>
				<p>
					Our project has the aim to help others improve their aim. We will achieve this by giving the user an application that allows them to practise their aim in short high intensity tasks, similar to a HIIT (high intensity interval training) workout. This is done through a short 60 second task where a user has the intention of achieving a high score, calculated by the amount of targets shot minus the amount of times the user missed, although the scoring system will become improved over time as more functions are implemented to differentiate between similar scores. Currently while developing a prototype application the current functions include score, shots missed and a countdown timer. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Upon opening this application the user is greeted with a main menu featuring a “play” button, “options” button and “quit” button which all currently function. Although upon pressing play the game level lighting appears different compared to game scene whilst editing it, this creating an obstacle which will have to be overcome. Once this project is completed, there should be a range of tasks to target specific skills required within the game for the user to improve, an accurate scoring system and smooth transitioning between game, menu and end screen.
				</p>
				<p>
					As many of our group members enjoy playing video games, and some have also used similar existing programs we decided that this would be a good project to create. Although there's already free ones, we aim to provide more features, stats and customizability than those, whilst aiming to create one better than paid applications. To achieve this task must be created that focus on specific skills to ensure that the user is able to improve through muscle memory and intensive work within those areas, as well as being able to provide statistics of each attempt to show improvement and what still needs to be improved. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The plan to create this is to separate the application into smaller separate tasks (main menu, game scene, score screen) and within each scene, create smaller tasks to eventually achieve a fully functional app. To begin I would create a main menu, over time this can be improved, but for the sake of the prototype it would have a play button, options button and quit button. The play button would change the scene so the user is able to play the game, options would give the user their own customisability and finally quit would close the application. After this was done the game scene would be created, starting by adding the character and camera movement, sensitivity adjustment and a weapon for the user to hold. Once the character is complete then there would have to be targets for them to shoot, done by using spheres and making them respawn in a random location once shot, which would also require the user the ability to shoot. Once shooting and respawning is done then there would need to be a countdown and thcore and misses counter, as well as a return to menu so the user is able to leave mid game if they’d like. To complete the functionality of the app there would be an end screen which would allow the user to play again or close the application.
				</p>
				<p>
					Progress:
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Main menu</b> - To begin the main menu an image was imported and changed to a sprite (2D and UI) and a canvas was added to the unity scene, as well as a panel so that the image can be added as the background.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then a few buttons were added so that the user can change scenes, open options and close the game. For the play button a PlayGame() function was added to change the scene on button press, then the quit button was set to a QuitGame() function that would close the application and lastly the options button which would require the most work out of the three main menu buttons. This required another menu (in the same scene) which would be disabled and enabled based when the buttons are pressed to show the options menu, as well as close it.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Game scene</b> - Now that the prototype menu is done a new scene for the game was added and also added into the build settings. This was the game scene, upon creating it the first things added were a few walls and a floor that could be used as a basic area. After this a cylinder was added to the scene and the camera was placed in it so that it would act as the user. For the user to be able to look around a PlayerScript was added to the player object, in this it would lock the users cursor to the middle of the screen as well as make it invisible so that the user could aim and stay tabbed into the game. To allow the player to look around a script was written to get the mouse inputs of the X and Y axis using Vector3, as well as clamping the Y axis 90 and -90 degrees so the user can’t look 360 degrees vertically. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to shoot targets there would need to be both a crosshair and a method of shooting. This was done by adding a canvas to the scene and a small square image centered in the canvas to act as the crosshair (which would later become customisable). To solve the shooting a new script was added to create a raycast when mouse1 was pressed.
				</p>
				<p>
					The target was then added as a sphere so that the raycast could be tested. When the target was hit, a script was then made to respawn the target in a random location, defined within an area made using an empty object with a box collider (disabled) and a script to find a random value for each the X, Y and Z axis within the box collider and reposition the target there. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Now that both the players ability to shoot and the target was made, within the raycast script, another few lines of code were added to check if the raycast hit a target, if a target was hit then a textbox would update to shot the amount of hits, else if the raycast did not collide with a target then a text box for misses would be updated and this would show the user the amount of hits and misses they had. To create a scoring system each target would give the user 10 points, each miss would minus 5 points and the end amount of misses would also be minused from the total, to prevent negative scores, if the score was less than or equal to 0 then the score would equal 0.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>End scene</b> - finally to finish the prototype the last scene was added to display scores and allow the user to play again or quit. This was done by once again adding a canvas and creating a background to the scene, as well as a button to change scene back to the previous (game) one to play again, with an option to quit the game. For the main purpose of this scene (to display scores) a few text boxes were added to show the hits, misses and final score. These were values updated whilst in game and were called upon during this scene to display for the user.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is the current progress for the prototype, all functions currently working and the game is playable. Roadblocks along the way were many coding issues that were resolved over time by re-reading the code or trying to change it. There were issues with lighting whilst testing the game within the unity engine but once the game was built these issues went away.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hopefully with more testing more issues will be discovered so that they may be fixed to iron out the quality of the game and as we progress further more tasks will be added to give the user more options than the current prototype.
				</p>
				<h4>Roles</h4>
				<p>
					For this project, our group has not defined roles for participants. Instead, we have split up sections of the assignment and assigned it to each member, making it clear that certain segments of the assignment would be harder and more time consuming to complete compared to other parts. The reason for not defining roles in our opinion is due to our group not being well-suited and skilled enough to specialise in roles such as Lead Developer, Technical Designer, User Interface Designer and so on. In order to combat not having such roles defined, our group has decided that the focus of the project was the prototype/artifact segment, therefore, we’ve agreed that once group members have completed their assigned segment in the assignment, this area would require the most attention and assistance.
				</p>
				<h4>Scope and Limits</h4>
				<p>
					This project is all about an ‘Aim Training’ software. This will train new or entry level gamers to improve their target in First-Person Shooter games such as Counter Strike: Global Offensive, Fortnite and many more.  For the available time and introductory period, we would only include a limited amount of options and setting in the system. At this stage, we would only make this available on the web.Also, the type of firing will be only one shot per click.  Later on we would add more and more options(Which would be described in further part of this section) to it.</p>
				<p>
					At this stage the features included in it will be:
					<ul>
						<li><b>Options to adjust sensitivity of mouse.</b><br>This option would enable the user to increase or decrease the speed of target cross in proportion to the movement of the mouse.</li>
						<li><b>Option to adjust speed, colors and size of targets </b><br>Changing this setting will enable the user to adjust the movement speed of targets on which the user will shoot. Users can increase or decrease the flashing and emerging speed of targets . In addition to that, colors and size of targets can be adjusted according to the user's comfort.</li>
						<li><b>Settings for tweaking field of view.</b><br>Users will be able to zoom in and out the screen for hitting aims.</li>
						<li><b>Change the color of the crosshair.</b></li>
					</ul>
				</p>
					<br>
				<p>Users will be able to see the following data after using this Aim Trainer:
					<ul>
						<li><b>Speed or reaction time.</b><br>As soon as the target appears on the screen, the time will be calculated between the flashing of the target and shooting it. When you quit the game, the average time of shooting each target will be recorded.</li><br>
						<li><b>Precision</b><br>As soon as you hit a target, the data will be recorded for the distance between the place where you shot and the centre of the aim. At the end, you will get precision data including: <br> 
							1) How many shots you had hit on the centre. <br> 
							2) How many of them were just mere hits, that means how many targets you hit were just shot on the edge. <br> 
							3) Average distance of targets hit from centre.</li><br>
						<li><b>Accuracy</b><br>The count of unnecessary gunshots or the missed gunshots. This will be represented in percentage form, calculated by shots (hit/Total number of shoots attempted)*100.</li><br>
						<li><b>Hand stability</b><br>The amount of unneeded movement of hand or mouse between two shots. For example, after attempting a shot your pointer moves here and there which could be avoided to increase precision and efficiency.</li><br>
						<li><b>Tips and guidances</b><br>After playing a considerable number of times, after each gameplay user will be provided a tip to improvise his scores.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
					<br>
					<p>On the homescreen, the user can access the following things:
					<ul>
						<li><b>Leaderboard</b><br>In this section, the user can have a look at some of the best scores around the world. Over here he can see some clips of some of the  phenomenal game plays of leaderboard toppers.</li>
						<li><b>Friends</b><br>The user can have a look at scores of his friends to increase a sense of competition.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
				<p>For the deliverables or if someone asks to demonstrate our project, it will be limited to above mentioned features. We will be demonstrating a highly refined as well as user friendly version of the system.<br>
Refinement and improvement will be done on the bases of user testing and feedback which will be discussed in the upcoming sections.</p><br>
				<p>If we talk about the parts or features which wouldn’t be available at this stage will be:
					<ul>
						<li><b>Game specific backgrounds and ammunation firing type</b><br>There will be only a common firing background. No different shooting scenarios would be available for a variety of games.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
				<p>
					For this project the tools used will be Unity Version 2020.3.8f1 which can be downloaded for free using a free license for students or another option that could be chosen is personal. Besides this no other software is needed, although whilst downloading unity it comes with Visual Studio which allows you to code in C#. In terms of hardware a computer is needed, but it does not need to have really good specs as unity is able to be run on a 2015 MacBook air (known from past experience). Upon opening unity you are greeted with package options and the FPS option was chosen although a new project was made without using the presets of this package for the prototype. As creating applications or more specifically games is a passion of many of our group members, we all have some experience although Ryan was the only one who had used unity before. Ryan - I have used unity in year 9 whilst creating my own FPS zombie game, beyond that I have created many other games all of which were made on other platforms using different coding languages, so I had to relearn a few things before starting this project.
				</p>
				<h4>Testing</h4>
				<p>
					User Testing is one of the most crucial processes during development of these kinds of projects. We would perform tests at small intervals of time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our first test will be at a stage when we complete building a prototype. At this stage, we would be able to feed in necessary features of our project. But at this particular point in time, our main focus would be to test the main goal of our project, i.e. aim improvising assistant, rather than focusing on the design and usability of the game. <br>
First of all, we would identify the potential users and analyse how we could bring out the best by testing different user groups. Initially, we would test our project through 2 different groups of people, pro-gamers and entry-level gamers.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first group would be some of the champions of e-sports, especially ones who have mastered first-person shooter games. We would hand over our prototype to them and record the average time they play it. We would try to improvise our project by asking them open-ended questions. This would be helpful because they would be the perfect judges of this project as they have mastered this section of aiming.<br>
					To understand, let us use a hypothetical situation. Suppose we approach a pro gamer to test our project. During his play, he could perfectly understand if the movement of targets really imitated the movement of enemies in the FPS games. According to their reviews, we could make tweaks into it.<br>
					Some of the  questions that will be included in our testing would be:
				<ul>
					<li>Are there any other types of statistics which you would like to see in this prototype?</li>
					<li>According to you, what could be some changes during the gameplay you would like to have which would be more fruitful?</li>
				</ul></p>
				<p>
				During testing of this user group, our motto will be to increase average gameplay time of the people we test. This will indicate to us whether or not our project really makes gamers stick to their gaming chairs for a long time. There would be a constant effort by us to increase this average gameplay time by constantly making changes based on feedback of group 1.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once we come to know that after making several changes, the average play time has become constant, we would move onto testing the next group of testers, which are ‘The entry level gamers’. This test would be a longer test as compared to testing of the first user group.
				</p>
				<p>
					While testing the second groups, our main motive would be to observe to what extent our project improvises the aim of the users. Because at the end of the day, this is what matters. For example, if we gradually increase the randomness and speed of the targets rather than just simply increasing the speed of the targets and the results were more fruitful than the previous tests, we would implement it.<br>
For this we would make use of ‘Usability Tests’.
				</p>
				<p>
					After this stage, we would have achieved a good amount of perfected completions of user expected tasks. we would then proceed towards the usability and design of the system.<br>
					For this we would make use of ‘Usability Tests’. In this process we would ask potential users to complete certain tasks and record the timings for it. We would compare the timings of the different models in which the buttons and adjustments would be at different places on the screen. For an instance, we have 3 different models in which the only difference would be button placements.  The model which offers the least average timings of completion of tasks will be finalised. At the same time, during designing the interface, Nielsen’s Heuristics and Usability principles will be kept in mind.

				<h4>Risks</h4>
				<p>
					There are many health risks with this project. When training, the user may become motion sick from constantly moving the camera. This will most likely be a settings problem with the game itself as motion sickness is caused by a wrong field of view (FOV), but the application will most likely have to place a warning before its use. </p>
				<p>
					Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is another risk as the user will be repeating very similar movements in order to train their aim. As a result, the repetition and increasing intensity and stress of perfecting their aim may cause damage to the muscles in their wrists. This can be avoided by proper aiming with the mouse. Rather than flicking with the wrists, the user should be instructed to move their arm to move the mouse. This can also be a problem as it may lead to “tennis elbow” or inflammation of the tissue connecting the forearm muscle and the elbow. Treatment is simply rest so placing a warning after a while of use may be necessary. While “tennis elbow” is less detrimental to the user than Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, it is still a risk to take into consideration. <br>
					If the user is playing on console, there is the risk of “Gamer’s thumb”. Also known as “De Quervain Tenosynovitis”, it is the inflammation of the thumb side of the wrist as a result of repetitive and excessive use of the thumbs. Like “tennis elbow”, it is treated by resting.<br>
					The user may also have eye strain as a result of watching or staring at the screen for long periods of time. This can lead to headaches, poor concentration, and damage to the eyes resulting in the user needing to wear glasses. A notification will need to be implemented in order to allow the user to rest their eyes after long periods of use.</p>

						There are also some psychological risks associated with gaming in general and as such aim training. Gaming addiction or internet gaming disorder (IGD) may lead the user to have lower sociability skills, withdrawal, increased dopamine threshold which can lead to decreased pleasure when completing other tasks or eating food leading to obesity and the need to play more in order to meet the dopamine threshold. If an online leaderboard is implemented into the application, this could lead to the user developing a lower mental self-image as a result of comparing scores with other players.

				<h4>Group process and communication</h4>
				<p>
					Meetings are done at least twice a week and group communication is completed through both Microsoft Teams and Facebook Messenger, however Facebook Messenger will be the primary as many group members check it more often and respond to it quicker than with Microsoft Teams. During the meetings, we will attempt to complete a task as well as discussing problems, solutions as well as future tasks or information about the tasks. If a group member does not respond, we will attempt to contact them through different means such as emails or Discord direct messages. As we have other courses as well as our own personal matters such as meals, work and hobbies to worry about, we try to be as understanding as possible when it comes to meetings, and work around everyone’s schedule. If all else fails, we will contact the teacher, Anthony Clapp, through email requesting assistance.

				<h4>Skills and Jobs</h4>
				<p>
					Designer| Programmer| Database Administrator| Marketer/Advertiser
				</p>
				<p>
					It is believed that these 4 roles will be required for the advancement to the next phase of our project.
				</p>
				<p>
					As the project is still in its early stages, a designer will be required to brainstorm ideas of creativity to ensure that the program stands out, performs well, is of good consistency standards and has fulfilled the program's intended function/purpose. A programmer is an essential to have for this project, for coding and troubleshooting the program, making sure that its performance is bug/error-free and that it runs accordingly. Pulling our focus away from the program’s design and coding, we have listed a database administrator as an essential position for our project to advance. The reason for having a DBA as a part of the project is due to the program’s nature consisting of recording of stats and data that would later need to be calculated and presented to the user as their result/ performance analysis. The presentation of this data is crucial and can be considered the focus of this project, it enables users to keep track of and see their statistical improvements. One position that branches off from the IT area is a marketer/advertiser/ marketing team, once the program is up and running the next step would be to somehow release it with succession and deliver it to its intended audience and develop a user base.
				</p>
				<p>
					It would be ideal for all 4 of these positions to work together and provide their each and own view/standpoint on any improvements/ opinions on the project as it would be nice and helpful to have the many opinions from different perspectives, improvements can always be considered, and if needed, adjusted/modified and implemented before the release of the project.
