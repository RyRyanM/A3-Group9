		<h3>Personal Information</h3>
		<h4>Ryan Mitchem</h4>
		<p>I am Ryan (s3902067). Born in Australia but also half Taiwanese and able to speak both English and Mandarin. My main hobby is playing video games, more specifically competitive shooters (such as Counter Strike:Global Offensive and Valorant). I also like to edit montage’s of my gameplay and play in the competitive scene. Since Highschool I have been studying and using technology in the forms of electronics, arduino, photoshop, and coding. Now studying Information Technologies I am learning CSS/HTML, more python, database concepts, UX/UI and more programming.</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Nicholas Han</h4>
		<p>My name is Nicholas Han. My student number is 3781290. My background is Malaysian Chinese. My hobbies include playing video games and reading manga. My IT interests started when I was younger, I watched anime and decided I wanted to either build a robot or mecha, which is a giant  armoured robot, typically controlled by a person riding inside the robot itself or a full dive system from Sword Art Online. As a result, programming became my focus. It turned into me liking programming and the euphoria that comes from finding a way to solve something. My IT experience is not much but it’s honest work. Just some programming languages like Java, Javascript, Html and Python.</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Phi Huynh</h4>
		<p>Hello, I am Phi. My student number is s3909043. I have a Vietnamese background. My hobbies consist of sleeping, watching anime/drama and going for long walks. My interest in IT stems from my IT experience that I had in high school, I did a 3 year Cert III. VET course in Digital media and Information Technology in which I learnt some software/hardware, MS Excel/Access, Databases, Setting up Macros, HTML/CSS and some general user-based design.</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Nguyen Hoang Long</h4>
		<p>My name is Nguyen Hoang Long. My student number is s3777219. I was born in a beautiful country which is Vietnam. If I were to pick one favourite hobby of mine out of the many I have, I will definitely pick playing games.  As a younger man, I started to have a passion for researching the technology aspect.  I search for everything and learn everything as i can until now. For example, editing video, designing ,drawing ,python. As a result, all of my childhood time is attached to technology. I don't have that much experience for IT work. I know and learn some basic for python, java, CSS/HTM and some general user based design.</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Ayush Patel</h4>
		<p>My name is Ayush Kamleshbhai Patel(s3891013). I am from India and I can communicate in English, Gujarati and Hindi. I am open to all sports but my specific interest is Table Tennis and cricket. From the very beginning of my childhood, I started gaining interest in modern day technologies, especially how Google worked at that time. Just search anything and all the results are in front of you. Gradually I gained interest in databases, web designing, etc. I don’t have any IT experience but I am comfortable with Python, HTML, SQL and UML.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Group Processes</h3>
		<p>We worked quite well together during assignment 2. A new change in this assignment’s process is that we received a new member to our group. He is very nice and friendly. After he joined, he had a beneficial impact on our group. To be more specific, he is just like a perfect puzzle piece left for our group. Hopefully, we also get in more meetings than last assignment but each meeting was very fruitful.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Career Plans</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Ryan:</b> Online Game Designer</li>
				<li><b>Phi:</b> Database Administrator</li>
				<li><b>Nicholas:</b> Game Programmer</li>
				<li><b>Long:</b> Website Developer</li>
				<li><b>Ayush:</b> Database Administrator</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			From initial observation, our group's ideal jobs are without surprise all related to Information Technology. The differences between each position vary as each persons’ job title are quite different from each other apart from the Database Administrator duplicate.
		</p>
		<p>
			 The online game designer position differs from the rest due to the nature of having “design” in its job title. Design generally covers a creative scope and usually involves going through an entire process from beginning to end of creating/ innovating a new game, brainstorming ideas and overlooking over the process to ensure that the initial intended blueprint of the game is completed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Database Administrators is the role that stands further apart from the rest of the group in terms of similarity. The reason for that being, is because there is little-to-none knowledge of coding required in this role. Instead, DBAs control, manage and maintain databases of information for, when required, ready to use to customize database solutions to suit required needs. To do these things, a DBA is expected to have extensive experience with database technologies such as MySQL, MS SQL, PostgreSQL Oracle, MongoDB
		</p>
		<p>
			Game Programmers focus on coding and troubleshooting, more of the behind the scenes of the functionality of the game and less on how the game would look as the visuals would be left up to the designer. They are expected to be one of the most creative minds around and should have Wide-ranging knowledge of gaming trends. In addition to that, they should have Strong analytical frame of mind. They should be able to to play with languages like C# and C++. Their main responsibilities are developing, maintaining and debugging game programs, ensuring that game applications meet functional and performance requirements. They should be able to work with teams such as designing teams to produce fruitful outcomes.
		</p>
		<p>
			Website Developers put simply are creators of websites, covering a wide range of areas that a website would need to function properly and well. A web developer should be able to create websites that meet client’s requirements by using languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and other relevant web design coding languages. He has to work with graphic designers to produce some of the best outcomes.
