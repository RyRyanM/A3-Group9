    <h4><b style="color: aliceblue;">•What does it do? 
    </b></h4>
    <p>Just have a look around you, you will find robots everywhere in your life whether it’s a simple robot like vacuum cleaner or more complex robots which work in manufacturing industries. In fact we can say that robots are one of the best inventions that humans and science have produced. You can get anything done by a robot. 
    </p>
    <p>As per the current technology, robots are categorised into 6 categories: -
    </p>
    <p>1)<b style="color: aliceblue;">Pre-programmed robots:</b>  They are operational in a controlled environment and are useful for doing a monotonous task such as welding or inserting a part in an engine. These kinds of robots are mostly used in industries.
    </p>
    <p>Pre-programmed robots are further divided into: (i)Cartesian Robots, (ii)Articulated Robots, (iii)SCARA Robots, (iv)Delta Robots</p>
    <p>(i) Cartesian Robots: The last one is Cartesian robots. They are mostly configured to have 3 or more linear actuators and brackets making it customisable according to its application and at the same time being cost effective by reducing complexity. Articulated robots can be attached to it to increase capabilities. A drawback of this type of robot is they can not work in dirty or dusty environments due to its exposed hinges and sliding parts.
    </p>
    <img src="https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/images/2019/07/11/cartesian.jpeg" width="300" height="250" style="margin-left: 3.75in; border-radius: 85%;">
    <p>(ii)Articulated Robots: The most commonly used robot is Articulated Robot. This is the type of robot which most people have perceptionised. It is much like a CNC machine. They are further classified by the number of axes or joints they have. The most common one is a 6 axis robot. These types of robots are generally used for industrial and commercial purposes such as welding, joining or cleaning ceilings or doing certain things with precision.</p>
    <img src="https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/images/2019/07/11/articulated.jpeg" width="300" height="250" style="margin-left: 3.75in; border-radius: 85%;">
    <p>(iii)SCARA Robots: The next one is  SCARA robot which means Selective Compliance Articulated Robot Arm. They are operational between two parallel planes and can do work like transferring the objects from one conveyor belt to another or inserting a pin in a vertical direction without binding it. They are lightweight, cost effective and efficient.But due to their limited arm length and fixed orientation  they have certain limitations.
    </p>
    <img src="https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/images/2019/07/11/scara.jpeg" width="300" height="250" style="margin-left: 3.75in;  border-radius: 85%">
    <p>(iv)Delta Robots: The other one is  Delta robots. They are also referred to as spider bots. It uses three base-mounted motors to actuate control arms that position the wrist. Unlike articulated robots, an actuator is mounted on a stationary wrist making it very light weight. This allows very swift movements where high speed operations are required.
    </p>
    <img src="https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/images/2019/07/11/delta.jpeg" width="300" height="250" style="margin-left: 3.75in;  border-radius: 85%">
    <p><b style="color: aliceblue;">Humanoid Robots:</b>  These robots look alike and are expected to do tasks which are done by humans such as running, walking etc. Also, they are given expressions and a human-like face. Examples of these robots are Asimo by Honda.</p>
    <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/akbL_DGjsz72rc4evTYHPPDro4E=/1400x1400/filters:format(jpeg)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/781590/asimo.jpeg" width="300" height="250" style="margin-left: 4.45in;  border-radius: 85%">
    
    <p><b style="color: aliceblue;">2)Autonomous Robots:</b> They can be operated independently of human operators.They are programmed to carry out tasks in an open environment without human supervision. Example is automatic vacuum cleaner by xiaomi.
    </p>
    <p><b style="color: aliceblue;">3)Teleoperated Robots:</b>  These are mechanical bots controlled by humans. They usually work in extreme geographical and environmental conditions. Example is underwater submarines used to fix pipelines or drones.

    </p>
    <p><b style="color: aliceblue;">4)Augmenting robot:</b>  They are designed to enhance current human capabilities or replace which are lost. Example is a false motorised limb or an exoskeleton used to lift heavy objects.
    </p>
    <p>In the upcoming years(about half a decade), we would see the robots everywhere even more frequently. Robots will be coworking with humans, in fact we would see that in some places robots would replace the humans such as robot waiters in the restaurant or customer service in retail stores. Even in the medical field, some surgeries will be performed along with robots with no or very less human intervention. Even some of the manufacturing industries are fully driven by robots starting from raw materials to end products. We have an example of a sushi restaurant in Hong Kong which is fully driven by robots(you can watch the video by clicking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOod4MuIGdc">here</a> 
        We will also see some humanoid robots taking over some tasks and Autonomous vehicles about which we talked in the last section is a type of robot.
        All this will be possible with exceptional development of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning along with advanced vision systems. With help of visions robots can identify what is happening and what to do next thus making it useful in manufacturing sectors like aerospace.
        </p>
    
    <h4><b style="color: aliceblue;">•What is the likely impact? </b>
    </h4>
    <p>Robots will make the life of humans very convenient. In the far future, we would also see that humanoid robots will live with humans in their homes and will perform tasks like cleaning and cooking.
    </p>
    <p>The robots will be taking over the industrial sector. Production will become fast and even with more precision with less room for mistake during manufacturing or assembly in the manufacturing chain. Robots will also be seen in defense, they will be accompanying the military as smart weapons and can be proved to be a fatal weapon for opponents. We can see that Israel has started deploying robots on their borders(you can read more <a href="https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20160824/p2a/00m/0na/020000c">here</a>
    </p>
    <p>At the same, robots will be competing with humans, which will negatively affect some of the jobs. According to a study by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/26/robots-could-take-over-20-million-jobs-by-2030-study-claims.html">CNBC</a> robots would take over 20 million jobs by 2030. These jobs will be mostly of low-skilled workers who tend to do basic tasks such as onloading and offloading of goods in a warehouse.It is due to the fact that robots can do the work with the same intensity throughout their working hours with minimal maintenance.This helps companies to save on wages that is to be given to employees.  For example, one multi-tasker robot innovated by Momentum Machines(An US based food chain which is totally dependent on robots for fulfilling its food orders.) can make a burger in McDonald’s in a few seconds which could probably replace all the entire McDonald’s crew. 
    </p>
    <p>But it will also create jobs for people who indulged into the following sectors: - </p>
        <p><u>AI</u>: It is a must during making of the robots so that more and more tasks can be done by a single type of robot. </p>
        <p><u>Software industry:</u> software which will be the driving force for the robots to complete intended tasks.
            </p>
        <p><u>Semiconductor and PCB industries:</u> This is the vital component to integrate all parts of robots.
            </p>
       
    
    <h4><b style="color: aliceblue;">•How this will affect me ?</b></h4>
    <p>For people, whether they are in tech or not, it would be extremely amazing to see robots doing simple household chores such as cleaning or automatically washing clothes as well as drying them. They would be used for every other work because the work can be boring, cumbersome or dangerous. In my house, the person who will be affected the most will be my mom as she will be aided with robots as her daily driver to complete her tasks. For example, more and more advanced machines will innovate similar to Dyson’s robotic cleaner which memorises the complete layout of the house to clean it. Highly evolved robots which are feeded with AI can also be used for stock trading. With its algorithms, it would suggest if the stocks of the particular company can be bought or not after studying a company’s finances. Also for me, as I am a foodie and fond of cooking food, machines such as automatic bread makers would be immensely helpful as it would improve the cooking experience. Not only that, some of my friends who are pursuing mechanical engineering, studying would be easier as they would be taking help of advanced robots like 3d printers which would be printing some complicated engineering models to be studied upon and it would be easier to understand. In addition to that, a type of robot which is an ‘autonomous car’ would be so fun to be taken away for a drive with family or friends. Just imagine that you are chatting with your friends and having fun and at the same time the car is driving on its own with minimum attention given on the road. Overall, we could say that life would be much more seamless once more and more robots are introduced in our daily lives.
