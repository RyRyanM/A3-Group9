				<h3>Individual reflections</h3>
				<h4>Long</h4>
				<p>
					In this assignment our team worked together very well. We have formed a lot of meetings but mostly we discussed a lot on messenger which on facebook. During the meeting, we divided all the parts for each member based on their strength. That's why our work progress finishes very fast. I feel like just 1 week before the deadline we have already finished almost everything. I feel that we can work this fast thanks to our new member Ayush. Not only did he play a role like a leader but also he connected all of our team members. Thanks to him our team has solved the problem in Assignment 2 which doesn't really have the person to step up to guide our team. Although there are still some problems, five of us still manage to finish everything.

					After my previous group was abandoned due to some reasons, I was allotted to this group. Members were so friendly that I didn’t feel that I was new to this group. We had 1-2 meetings in a week. I was extremely shocked by the pace with which everybody worked on their parts, after just a few days we completed our assigned tasks. Nicholas was really quick on his website and google docs part. I have no words for Ryan, an extremely geek person. Within just a span of 3 days or so, he managed to produce a prototype. I really appreciate the effort made by each and every member of the group, really smart people around there. Phi managed to do an equal distribution of work for each of us. Gradually, Long is a very nice person, we had a lot of discussions about assignments and all. To be honest, everything went smoothly. The thing which I agree could be improved was the attendance of the meetings, but nobody is responsible for that, some are working at it is totally good. We regularly post updates about the summary of the meeting so that anybody does not miss what was discussed in the meeting.

					This assignment turned out to be a lot like the previous assignment but with extra steps. We formed a few more meetings than last time but discussion was still mostly over messenger. We did receive a new team member, Ayush, who has been extremely helpful in motivating us to complete our tasks. For this assignment, we split into two groups to work on the website and prototype while all contributing to the google doc for the website. I worked on the website along with Ayush’s help and Ryan worked on the prototype. I did previously mention in assignment two that noise gating is extremely useful when having a voice meeting and I continue to stand by that. Although the background noise was not very disruptive, it was still very noticeable and got a bit annoying. While we did make very good progress during meetings, some of us still seem to struggle with completing tasks in between them. This however could be due to the fact that we don’t always complete tasks in the google doc where it is visible and may have completed or partially completed and saved them to our own individual desktop. Completion of work in between meetings however has increased with the motivation from Ayush.

				<h3>Group reflection</h3>
				<p>
					Working in a group is very common in high education. It's universally known that group assignments can be a headache to deal with. The skill is very useful not only for the university but also helpful in the workplace. Still there are some enormous challenges that we are facing when forming a group .In this last group assignment , everything seems to be very different . Although we still face numerous difficulties about how to organize the group work just like the last group work, the same problem does not happen with us.  We already have some changes and improvements. The gigantic impact that our team positively changes is having a new teammate in the group.
				</p>
				<p>
					To begin with, let 's talk about the weaknesses that our group still has.  Our team is still facing lack of communication during the meeting. After dividing our job and asking some questions about the project our group usually remains silent for the whole section. Mostly, our group communicates through messenger by chatting. The other things that our group could be prevent to get better is get fully attendance in the meeting. Sometimes we just miss one to two people. But we can't all blame them. Since they might have some problem that they could not attend the meeting.To fix this problem after every meeting we post updates about the summary of the meeting so that anybody does not miss what was discussed in the meeting.
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite the problem that I listed upward, all of the members did a very good job. As I say in assignment 2 our team still keeps up the fast working progress tempo. Maybe our group strategy is to use the discussion time to finish the individual work as quickly as we can.  In the individual reflection part we all agree that Ayush plays a role as a leader in the group. Not only he motivates each member to do their task but also he is the one who sets our meeting times. All of the leader problems in assignment 2 just gone when we have him. Furthermore all of the members' contribution in this assignment is excellent.
				</p>
				<p>
					We were very surprised how effective our group work is when we have a good leader. Not only is each member's contribution higher than last assignment but also our meeting time is also increased. The thing that we have learned in this assignment is how to work as a team and how to function properly. To be more specific, each member has different characteristics so we have to choose the best option to help the group work as smoothly as possible.
